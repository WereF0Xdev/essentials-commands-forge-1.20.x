# Essentials Commands

Essentials Commands is a Minecraft mod designed to add useful commands for server owners to manage their server and add quality of life commands and features.

Most of the commands take inspiration from the plugin EssentialsX, aiming to provide a similar alternative for Forge and in the future, for other loaders.
